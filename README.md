# CS2 Bot Warmup Map

# Summary
Even though test access is roughly at 1/3 players, there is still no workshop support. Nonetheless, this repo is dedicated to hosting warmup map(s) that players can manually install for themselves. You can see gameplay of `bot_warmup2` on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fFOHmCqRcU).

# How To Install

1. Download the latest version of the map from the [releases page](https://github.com/matth2k/bot_warmup/releases). Here is [v1.0](https://github.com/matth2k/bot_warmup/releases/download/v1.0/bot_warmup2.vpk).
2. Copy the vpk file to `Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\maps` relative to where CS2 is installed.

# How To Play
1. Load the map via console with `game_type 0; game_mode 0; map bot_warmup2`
